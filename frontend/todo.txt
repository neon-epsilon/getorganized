Reset input form after successfully POSTing its contents

Stop retrying a failed AJAX request after timeout, instead reload.
Also: Check, which failed AJAX requests should just be tried again, and which should just fail.
(Right now, every AJAX request that fails is just tried again.)

After initial GET request fails with 401 (not authorized), stop retrying.

Make sure that shoppinglist is readable, even with long entries.
